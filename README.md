# swift-ios-mvvm
This is a demo of how to implement simple MVVM in Swift 3

# What it shows?
A simple MVVM application, where one model, viewed by two objects
One is the text fields and labels, the other is just printing to
the debug, each one views the object from a different point of view.
Shown here as a "factor" that is multiplied by the double value of
model.

# Techniques used
- KVO (Key Value Observation)
- Swift 3 (It will be much easier and better in Swift 4, because
it is now made native in Swift, not just by using Objective-C like
code like this.

# TODO
- Make this in Swift 4
- Make something that observe to list (Called to-many relation in KVO)
